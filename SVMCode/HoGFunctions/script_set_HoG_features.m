function script_set_HoG_features
% Calculate the linear HoG index to (x,y) format:
% The output file has 5 columns and each of them means:
% 1-	feature index number
% 2-	the type of the HoG feature (in this implementation this number 
%       is the same for all the features, but I used to have more than 
%       one when I worked with squares and rectangles regions).
% 3-	The size of the square (in pixels)
% 4-	The x position (assuming the patch has size 32x32 pixels)
% 5-	The y position
