  abstract =  {<p>Training of support vector machine (SVM) requires the solution
	of a very large quadratic programming (QP) problem. This paper proposes
	an algorithm for training SVM's: Sequential Minimal Optimization,
	or SMO. SMO breaks the large QP problem into a series of smallest
	possible QP problems which are analytically solvable. Thus, SMO does
	not require a numerical QP library. SMO's computation time is dominated
	by evaluation of the kernel, hence kernel optimizations substantially
	quicken SMO. For the MNIST database, SMO is 1.7 times as fast as
	PCG chunking; while for the UCI adult databse and linear SVM's, SMO
	can 1500 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm.</p>},
